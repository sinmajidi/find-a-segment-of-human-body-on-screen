hello every body!
this is a project to find a point of body position on screen.
as you can see in body.png,the mediapipe divide the body to 32 segment.we want to find a segment position on screen.
open point position.py,you can put a number between 0 to 32 in position to find a point in body or you can find 4 segment witch i recommend it in line 6-14.
the showposition function in PoseModule.py can draw a circut around the selected segment and findapointposition can print the position of segment based on pixel.
